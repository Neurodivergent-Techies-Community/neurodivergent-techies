# Code of conduct

Welcome to the Neurodivergent Techies Community! This is a supportive space for neurodivergent people in tech to connect, share, and thrive. 

We do encourage you to read the full code of conduct but here is a TLDR; for quick reference and ensure you have the key bits: 

- Your server nickname must be full name.  
- We are a space for all neurotypes, and welcome those who are self-diagnosed and exploring a diagnosis too. 
- Respect individual preferences around lamguage eg disability, superpower etc 
- Don't share screenshots of the server outside of it 
- No medical misinformation 


## **🤝 Section 1. Trust and Membership**

- **Use your real full name** as your Discord nickname (to set a server-specific nickname go to your profile → edit profile → per server profile → select our server → set your nickname as your full name. You may be temporarily restricted if you fail to do this, especially if an admin has flagged it to you. 

- This space is for neurodivergent people in tech only -  including those self-diagnosed or exploring identity.

- **We welcome all neurotypes**  - including ADHD, Autism, BPD, OCD, PTSD, Epilepsy, NPD, and more. Don’t use diagnoses as insults (e.g., “narcissist”).

- Respect how people relate to their neurodivergence, whether as a superpower, disability, or something else. **Please don’t tell others how to view their experience.** 

## **🔒 Section 2. Privacy and Safety**

- Do not share invite links directly-  instead, refer people via this form: https://tally.so/r/m6rAYo

- No screenshots or reposting of anything from this server, even with names redacted.

- Don’t disclose someone’s identity, neurodivergence, or story without their explicit consent.

## **💬 Section 3. Respectful Communication**: 

- Be kind, even in disagreement. Avoid sarcasm, tone-policing, or dismissing someone’s experience.

- It’s okay to express frustration with healthcare or diagnosis systems but don’t make sweeping claims, e.g. “Big Pharma is keeping us sick.” or “Doctors are overmedicating us” (Belle Gibson did this, and people suffered and even died as a result) 

- This is designed to be a safe space in which we may all be authentic and open BUT freedom of speech must not infringe upon anyone's ability to feel safe in this space. We are all accountable for our words and actions.

- This space prioritises support, care, and psychological safety over polarising discussion.

- Admins may step in if language becomes harmful or inflammatory.


## **🧪 Section 4. Medical Advice and Misinformation**

- Do not offer medical advice unless you’re a qualified professional.

- You’re welcome to share your personal journey, just be clear it’s anecdotal, not prescriptive.

- Don’t promote or recommend illegal drugs (unless they’re legal when prescribed, like ADHD medication).

- Share resources from credible sources only; misinformation may be removed.

## **🏳️‍🌈 Section 5. Identity and Pronouns**

- We encourage everyone to add pronouns; you can do this by going to profile -> edit profile.
- Respect everyone’s pronouns. Do not intentionally misgender or deadname any individual.
- Respect an individual’s preference for how they view their condition/identity/disability. For example, some people may prefer to say “I am a person with Autism”, and others may prefer to say “I am Autistic”.

## **📣 Section 6. Promotions and Direct Messages** 

- Use #promote-paid-stuff to share ND-friendly products or services that cost something. 

- Free stuff can be shared/promoted anywhere else like the resources channel. 

- No spamming, and no unsolicited DMs promoting anything.

## **🚫 Section 7. Harassment and Boundaries** 

Neurodiversity Techies is committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for all members. Harassment of any kind is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- **Offensive Comments:** Remarks or slurs targeting gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.
- **Lifestyle Criticism:** Unwelcome comments or judgments about a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, such as those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, employment, or other personal matters.

- **Inappropriate Content:** Sharing or referencing sexual images, language, or behaviour in contexts where it is not relevant or appropriate.
- **Unwelcome Physical Simulations:** Text-based or symbolic actions simulating physical contact (e.g., “*hug*,” “*backrub*”) without prior consent or after being asked to stop.
- **Violence and Threats:** Threatening harm, encouraging violence, or inciting actions such as self-harm or suicide.
- **Intimidation:** Deliberately creating fear or discomfort through threatening or hostile actions or language.
- **Disruption:** Persistent interruptions, trolling, or behaviours intended to derail or disrupt discussions or activities.
- **Unwelcome Sexual Advances:** Any unwelcome sexual attention, including comments, jokes, or gestures.
- **Communication Violations:** Continuing to contact someone after they have explicitly requested you stop, whether in private or public channels.
- **Privacy Breaches:** Sharing private communications or information without explicit consent, even if the content itself is not harassing.
