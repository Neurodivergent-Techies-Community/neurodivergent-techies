# Code of conduct

Welcome to our Neurodiversity Techies Discord Server! This is a safe space for neurodivergent people in tech to connect, share, and support each other. Your community admins are Parul Singh, Callum Fraser and Jonathan Fielding. By being a member of this community, you agree to the following guidelines:

### **Trust and Inclusivity:**

- Your Discord nickname for this server should be your full real name. You can change your nickname for this server only, which won‚Äôt affect your nickname for other servers. If you fail to do this, you risk removal from the community.
- As much as we love our allies, this is a safe space for **neurodivergent people in tech only**. We operate on a trust basis, so please do not intentionally misrepresent yourself.
- By being part of the community, you agree to support **all neurotypes.** The term ‚ÄúNeurodivergent‚Äù includes anyone whose brain functions differently. As well as covering things like ADHD, Autism and Dyslexia, it also includes things like BPD, Epilepsy, PTSD, OCD, NPD, etc. Please do not use words like ‚Äúnarcissist‚Äù as an insult.
- This is a space for those who are self-diagnosed, in the process of diagnosis or suspect neurodivergence. By being part of the community, you agree to NOT selectively support those with a medical diagnosis.

### **Respect privacy:**

- Please do not share the invite page or invite link with¬†anyone;¬†as admins, we need to be able to vet who joins the community to keep it a safe space. ****If you want to invite someone, please send them the invite form to fill out: https://tally.so/r/m6rAYo.
- Do not share any member‚Äôs or admin‚Äôs sensitive information outside of this community without explicit permission, including discussions in private channels.
- Do not disclose someone‚Äôs neurodivergence outside of the community without express permission. Some people are comfortable being open in the community but not to their employer or network.
- Do not share screenshots of any part of this community, including public channels, outside the community, regardless of its content and whether you‚Äôve attempted to ‚Äúredact‚Äù names. Apps can be used to remove this. This is critical to ensure it remains a safe space.
- Do not use individuals‚Äô names maliciously, even if they are not a part of this community.

### **Be kind and respectful**:

- We encourage a healthy discussion but ensure you remain respectful and kind. And ensure you don‚Äôt invalidate or dismiss peoples own experiences just because they‚Äôre different to yours.

Example: someone says, ‚ÄúI see my neurodivergence as a superpower‚Äù

üëéüèæ Don‚Äôt say: **‚ÄúThat's stupid. How can you see it as a superpower???‚Äù** 

üëçüèæ It would be fine to say something like: **‚ÄúI personally don‚Äôt see mine as a superpower but that‚Äôs fair enough if you do‚Äù** 

### **No medical advice, promoting illegal drugs or pseudoscience:**

- Do not promote any drugs that are classed as a controlled drug in the UK, apart from those licensed for use for treatment of ADHD.
- While we encourage you to share your experiences, please avoid giving blanket medical advice and ensure you are clear that what you‚Äôre sharing is anecdotal.
- When sharing resources or information, please do your due diligence to ensure the source is credible.

### **Respect Identity and Pronouns:**

- We encourage everyone to add pronouns; you can do this by going to profile -> edit profile.
- Respect everyone‚Äôs pronouns. Do not intentionally misgender or deadname any individual.
- Respect an individual‚Äôs preference for how they view their condition/identity/disability. For example, some people may prefer to say ‚ÄúI am a person with Autism‚Äù, and others may prefer to say ‚ÄúI am Autistic‚Äù.

### **No Predatory or Exploitative Promotions**

- Promoting services, products or events deemed to be predatory or exploitative of neurodivergent people will be removed by the admins. Persistent violations will result in removal from the community.
- Please use the #promote-paid-stuff channel for this, as we do want to support ND folks being financially independent. But please do not spam members through unsolicited direct messages or other channels when promoting paid stuff.

### **Harassment**

Neurodiversity Techies is committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment for all members. Harassment of any kind is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- **Offensive Comments:** Remarks or slurs targeting gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other personal characteristic.
- **Lifestyle Criticism:** Unwelcome comments or judgments about a person‚Äôs lifestyle choices and practices, such as those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, employment, or other personal matters.

- **Inappropriate Content:** Sharing or referencing sexual images, language, or behaviour in contexts where it is not relevant or appropriate.
- **Unwelcome Physical Simulations:** Text-based or symbolic actions simulating physical contact (e.g., ‚Äú*hug*,‚Äù ‚Äú*backrub*‚Äù) without prior consent or after being asked to stop.
- **Violence and Threats:** Threatening harm, encouraging violence, or inciting actions such as self-harm or suicide.
